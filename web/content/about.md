## About

Live forecasts and climatology of optical turbulence profiles ($C_n^2$) and column-integrated
parameters (Fried parameter $r_0$ and scintillation index $\sigma_I^2$) over the Netherlands
produced by the deep learning model OTProf.

OTProf takes pressure level data from GFS (forecast) or ERA5 (climatology) as input and estimates $C_n^2$ profiles from it.
The $C_n^2$ profiles for training are produced by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model.
