"""Step 1: download the lead times `LEADS` of the run's GFS cycle (picked by step 0) in `AREA_NL` →
`1_raw/gfs_<cycle>+<lead>.nc`.

GFS comes from the NOAA archive on AWS (no account needed). Each file is written as `.part` and renamed when complete,
so lead times that exist are complete: an interrupted download continues where it stopped.
