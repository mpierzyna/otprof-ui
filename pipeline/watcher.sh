# Every INTERVAL seconds (default 3600): process a new GFS cycle (forecast/run.sh, stops quietly if there is none), then
# mirror the web app's data to the server (upload.sh). The upload runs on every check, whatever the forecast did: a failed
# upload is repeated within the hour, and a new climatology goes out with the next check. A failed run is logged and
# retried at the next check (an interrupted forecast run is resumed). Stop with Ctrl-C or SIGTERM.
