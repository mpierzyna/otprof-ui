# Data format `otprof-ui-forecast/1`

The web app reads only static files below one data root (`dataUrl` in `web/public/config.json`, default `data/`).
Nothing about the grid, the heights, the lead times or the variables is fixed in the app: everything comes from the
files described here. `pipeline/src/otprof_ui/webui.py` (`write_cycle`) is the reference writer.

```
data/
  index.json                 list of the available forecast cycles
  2026102300/                one directory per cycle (any name, listed in index.json)
    meta.json                grid, heights, lead times, variables, files
    lcn2_f000.bin ...        binary arrays (one file per lead time for variables with heights)
    r0.bin, lsi2.bin         binary arrays (all lead times in one file for variables without heights)
    otprof-ui_<cycle>_EXPERIMENTAL.nc   optional, the forecast as NetCDF for download (see meta.json "download")
  climatology/               optional climatology (format otprof-ui-clim/1, see below)
```

## `index.json`

```json
{
  "format": "otprof-ui-forecast/1",
  "cycles": ["2026102300", "2026102218"],
  "latest": "2026102300"
}
```

- `cycles`: directory names, newest first. The app offers them in a selector.
- `latest`: the cycle shown by default (optional, default: the first in `cycles`).
- `climatology`: directory of the climatology (optional, e.g. `"climatology/"`). If set, the app shows the tabs
  *Live forecast* and *Climatology*.

| key | meaning |
|---|---|
| `cycle` | forecast initialisation, ISO 8601 UTC. The valid time of lead `h` is `cycle + h` hours. |
| `lead_hours` | lead times [h], increasing. Any spacing. |
| `lat`, `lon` | cell centres [degrees north / east], increasing. Any (also irregular) spacing; cell edges are the midpoints. |
| `z_agl` | heights [m above ground], increasing. Needed if any variable has the dimension `z`. |
| `info` | optional, shown as key-value pairs in the app. |
| `notes` | optional, notes on this cycle as plain text (paragraphs separated by blank lines), shown below the text of the forecast (`web/content/forecast.md`). |
| `download` | optional, a file of this cycle the app offers for download (`file`, size in `bytes`), after a disclaimer. The forecast pipeline writes the forecast as CF NetCDF: `lcn2` (time, z, lat, lon), `r0`, `lsi2` (time, lat, lon), float32, compressed, lcn2 rounded to 0.001, licence CC BY-SA 4.0, with the credit of the GFS data and the references in the global attributes `acknowledgement` and `references`. |
| `variables` | the fields. The app shows them in this order. |

Per variable:

| key | meaning |
|---|---|
| `dims` | `["lead", "z", "lat", "lon"]` (profiles) or `["lead", "lat", "lon"]` (column values such as r0, lsi2). |
| `dtype` | `"uint16"` or `"float32"`, little-endian. |
| `scale`, `offset` | value = `offset + scale * stored` (optional for float32, default 1 and 0). |
| `fill` | stored value of missing data (uint16; for float32, NaN is missing). Missing cells are transparent. |
| `files` | one file per lead time, each `[z][lat][lon]` (or `[lat][lon]`), in the order of `lead_hours`. |
| `file` | alternatively one file with all lead times, `[lead][z][lat][lon]` (or `[lead][lat][lon]`). |
| `long_name`, `units` | optional, for labels (`web/public/config.json` can override them). |
| `valid_range` | optional, [min, max] of the data; profile axis range. |
| `display_range` | optional, colour scale range (e.g. 1st to 99th percentile). `config.json` can override it. |
| `display_range_z` | optional, for variables with `z`: one [min, max] per height, for maps with a colour scale per height. |

Arrays are C order (last dimension fastest), without header. Cells that are missing at all lead times (outside the
domain) cannot be selected in the app.

## Climatology (`otprof-ui-clim/1`)

Statistics per calendar month, written by `pipeline/src/otprof_ui/webui.py` (`write_climatology`, run by `pipeline/climatology/step_5_convert_webui.py`). `climatology/meta.json` is like a cycle's
`meta.json` (`lat`, `lon`, `z_agl`, `info`, `notes`, `variables` with the same encoding keys), without `cycle` and
`lead_hours`; the time slider steps through the months:

```json
{
  "format": "otprof-ui-clim/1",
  "months": [1, 2, 12],
  "hours": [0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21],
  "years": [[2014], [2014], [2023]],
  "stats": ["median", "mean", "p5", "p25", "p75", "p95", "lmean"],
  "variables": {
    "lcn2": {
      "dims": ["month", "stat", "z", "lat", "lon"], "stats": ["median", "mean", "p5", "p25", "p75", "p95", "lmean"],
      "dtype": "uint16", "scale": 0.0001, "offset": -22.2, "fill": 65535, "valid_range": [-22.2, -13.0],
      "display_ranges": {"median": [-17.5, -14.0]}, "display_ranges_z": {"median": [[-15.8, -14.1]]},
      "files": ["lcn2_m01.bin", "lcn2_m02.bin"],
      "diurnal_profiles": {"dims": ["month", "hour", "stat", "z"], "stats": ["median", "mean", "p5", "p25", "p75", "p95", "lmean"], "cells": "lcn2_diurnal/{cell}.bin"}
    },
    "r0": {
      "dims": ["month", "stat", "lat", "lon"], "stats": ["median", "mean", "p5", "p25", "p75", "p95"],
      "file": "r0.bin",
      "diurnal": {"dims": ["month", "hour", "stat", "lat", "lon"], "stats": ["median", "mean", "p5", "p25", "p75", "p95"], "file": "r0_diurnal.bin"}
    }
  }
}
```

| key | meaning |
|---|---|
| `months` | calendar months (1 to 12), the steps of the time axis. |
| `hours` | hours [UTC] of the diurnal cycle. |
| `years` | per month, the years in the sample (shown in the app: months from few years are less representative). |
| `periods` | optional, statistics of one hour per day besides those of all hours (`day`, `night`): `utc_hour` the hour of `hours` used. If set, the app offers *Global*, *Day*, *Night*; see `periods` per variable. |
| `downloads` | optional, the statistics as files for download, after a disclaimer: `label`, `file`, size in `bytes`; see below. |
| `acknowledgement` | optional, the credit of the input data (ERA5), one line of text: the app writes it into the CSV files of profiles. |
| `stats` | all statistics, in the order the app offers them. `median`, `mean`, `pN` (Nth percentile); `lmean` is the log10 of the mean of the linear values of a log10 variable (lcn2, lsi2; `mean` is the mean of the log10 values, the log10 of the geometric mean). The app shows `lmean` as the mean when it shows such a variable linearly (10^value); the percentiles are the same in both scales. The app needs `p5`, `p25`, `p75`, `p95` for the bands. |

Per variable, in addition to the cycle keys:

| key | meaning |
|---|---|
| `stats` | the statistics of this variable, in the order of the `stat` dimension of its files. |
| `files` | one file per month, each `[stat][z][lat][lon]` (variables with `z`). |
| `file` | alternatively one file `[month][stat][lat][lon]` (variables without `z`). |
| `display_ranges`, `display_ranges_z` | per statistic, the colour scale range (and per height), over all months. |
| `diurnal` | optional diurnal cycle, `[month][hour][stat][lat][lon]` with its own `stats`, same encoding as the variable. |
| `diurnal_profiles` | optional diurnal cycle of a variable with `z` (lcn2), with its own `stats`, same encoding as the variable: one file per cell, `cells` with `{cell}` for the cell index (lat index × number of lons + lon index), each `[month][hour][stat][z]` (~130 KB; the app loads the cell selected). |
| `violin` | optional distributions of the diurnal cycle for violin plots: densities scaled to a maximum of 1 per month, hour and cell at the bin centres `x` of the variable, with their own encoding (`dtype` `uint8`, `scale`, `offset`, `fill`); `files`: one per month, each `[lat][lon][hour][x]` (each violin contiguous: compresses well). The app loads the month shown when the violins are on (~0.6 MB per variable and month, ~0.13 MB with gzip). |
| `violin_linear` | optional, of a log10 variable: the same of its linear values (`x` linear, 10^value), estimated in linear space; the app uses them when it shows the variable linearly. |
| `violin_month` | optional distributions per month (all hours) for violin plots of the annual cycle: as `violin`, but one `file` `[month][lat][lon][x]`. |
| `violin_month_linear` | optional, of a log10 variable: the same of its linear values. |
| `periods` | optional, per period the `files` or `file`, `violin_month` and `violin_month_linear` of that period, which replace those of the variable. Same statistics, encoding and `display_ranges` as all hours (over all periods), so that colours compare. The diurnal cycle is the same for all. |

### Files for download

`otprof-clim_monthly_EXPERIMENTAL.nc` and `otprof-clim_diurnal_EXPERIMENTAL.nc`, listed in `downloads`: CF NetCDF of the whole domain, compressed, licence CC BY-SA 4.0, with the credit of the ERA5 data and the references in the global attributes `acknowledgement` and `references`. With `lat`, `lon` and `z` (height above ground [m]) increasing:

| variable | monthly | diurnal |
|---|---|---|
| `lcn2`, `cn2` | (period, month, stat, z, lat, lon) | (month, hour, stat, z, lat, lon) |
| `r0`, `si2` | (period, month, stat, lat, lon) | (month, hour, stat, lat, lon) |
| `n`: time steps | (period, month) | (month, hour) |

- `period`: `global` (all hours), `day`, `night` (see `periods` of `meta.json`). `hour`: UTC.
- `stat` of the monthly file: `mean`, `std`, `min`, the percentiles `p0.01` .. `p99.99` with `median`, `max`, `iqr`. Of the diurnal file: `mean`, `p5`, `p25`, `median`, `p75`, `p95`, `iqr`.
- `lcn2`: log10 Cn2, rounded to 0.001. `cn2` (m^-2/3), `si2`: linear, computed from the linear samples, 3 significant digits (at most ~0.5 % off). `r0` (cm): rounded to 0.001. The percentiles of `cn2` agree with 10^`lcn2` up to the interpolation between neighbouring samples (at most ~5 % with few time steps); the `mean` of `lcn2` is the log10 of the geometric mean.

## Serving

Plain files, so any static web server works. Recommended for nginx: gzip for `application/json` and
`application/octet-stream` (or pre-compressed `.gz` files with `gzip_static on`), and short caching for `index.json`
(it changes every cycle) while the cycle directories never change once published. Write a cycle directory completely
before adding it to `index.json`.
